Description: pataqu uses permutationnal approach to deal with data that comes with 
 uncertainties on x. It it typically aimed at working with temporal data that are not exactly defined
 but comes with lower (and upper) bounds, also called terminus ante (and post) quem. It can 
 also be used when dating, typically radiocarbon datation, comes with a confidence interval likely 
 to affect interpretation. More generally, it is a permutationnal approach that allows to 
 inspect both graphically and statistically the effects of x uncertainties.
